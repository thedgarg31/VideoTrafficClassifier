# Approach

Our solution is unique because:
- Uses **real-world dataset** (not synthetic) collected across 10+ SNS platforms.
- Achieves **real-time classification (<100ms)** on mobile with TensorFlow Lite (<100KB models).
- Combines **ML + heuristics** for fallback classification in extreme network impairment.
- Privacy-first design → Only metadata inspection, no payload capture.
- Scalable → Same pipeline works for mobile, lab simulations, and enterprise deployments.
